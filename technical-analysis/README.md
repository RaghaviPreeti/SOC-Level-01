# Technical Analysis

This section contains focused technical analysis aligned with the SOC Level 01 scope, examining observable behaviors and detection-relevant artifacts across network and web environments.

The analysis emphasizes how visibility is achieved through packet-level inspection and log-based detection, and how these perspectives complement each other within a SOC context.

## Tools Referenced

- **Wireshark**  
  Used for packet-level network traffic analysis to examine protocols, flows, and indicators of suspicious behavior.

- **Snort**  
  Referenced for network-based intrusion detection, rule logic, and understanding how alerts are generated from observed traffic patterns.

## Concepts Covered

- **Packet Analysis**  
  Inspection of network traffic at the protocol and packet level to identify anomalous behavior, scanning activity, spoofing, and man-in-the-middle indicators.

- **Log Filtering and Correlation**  
  Use of filtering and rule-based logic to isolate relevant events, reduce noise, and surface security-significant activity.

- **Detection-Relevant Observations**  
  Mapping observed traffic patterns and behaviors to detection logic, highlighting how packet analysis and rule-based detection support investigation and response.

The files within this directory focus on technical observations and analytical reasoning derived from network and web traffic analysis, with emphasis on visibility, detection, and investigation within a SOC context.
